            <p>
            Based on the paper <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/035352v1">Biological screens from linear codes: theory and tools</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Code available at <a href="https://github.com/aconz2/rspt">github.com/aconz2/rspt</a> which also has a python implementation
            </p>

            Changing the parameters will update the testing matrix. Each row is a pool which contains a black box where the corresponding sample will be present in that pool.
            Each sample is present in <b>m</b> pools.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can enter a comma separated list of positive pools in the text box, click the checkmark next to the pool, or click on the sample. Clicking on a sample button will mark all pools it
            is a member of as positive.
            </p>
            <p>
            The conclusion you can draw from a pooled (or even unpooled) experiment is never certain because of an unknown false positive and false negative rate. Therefore, the output shown
            is a list of all samples which have participated in at least 1 pool which was positive (in the most extreme case, even samples with zero positive pools might all be false negatives, but for compactness, they are excluded). We then display the ratio of number of positive pools to the total number of pools that sample is in (which is always <b>m</b>). With high confidence (again depending on FPR &amp; FNR), samples with a ratio of 1 (all of it's pools were positive) are likely to be positive. Ratios close to 1 like 5/6 are also potentially positive if it is within expectation that 1 pool out of 6 was a false negative.
